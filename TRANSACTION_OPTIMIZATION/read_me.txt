This demo is entirely based on the following paper :
http://www.courant.nyu.edu/~almgren/papers/optliq.pdf

It contains a mupad document : symbolic_demo.mn
I did struggle to get something nice with the symbolic toolbox.
I was not able to drive a continuous workflow and had to recode some equations myself.
I nevertheless managed to get a closed form solution for the simplified linear cost model.

It contains a MATLAB demonstrating script : working_script.m
For more sophisticated cost model, there is no more closed form 
and we there highlighted MATLAB numerical optimization abilities (fmincon).

It contains an Optimization Apps you can install.
Just launch the optimization with the default parameters.
And then switch the slider between volatility risk and liquidation costs
to see the trading strategies evolve on the efficient frontier.

It contains a power point to help you present this complex topic.
Beware you might want to hide some of the slides !!
